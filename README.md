rpgboss-editor
==============

RPG game editor. Runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac. Authored games eventually will run on mobile platforms also. Based on libgdx.

Licensed under AGPL3.

Building
--------

Below directions assume a POSIX environment. It should still work on Windows (I've done it), but you may need to modify the directions slightly.

Pre-requisites:

+  git
+  sbt - http://www.scala-sbt.org/
+  Java

Build instructions:

1. Clone this repo and enter it.

```
git clone https://github.com/tommycli/rpgboss.git
cd rpgboss
```

2. Run sbt. Once you are in the sbt prompt, run these commands to pull in extra dependencies:

```
sbt
> update-gdx
> update-libs
```

3. You should still be in the sbt prompt. Switch to the 'editor' subproject, compile, and package it.

```
> project editor
> compile
> package
```

4. You can run the editor from the sbt prompt also.

```
> run
```

Packaging into binaries
-----------------------

1. Install launch4j.

2. Enter the repository and run the package shell script.

```
cd rpgboss
./package/package.sh
```

3. Find your binaries in:

```
$ ls package/target/
rpgboss-editor.exe  rpgboss-editor-linux.tar.gz
```
