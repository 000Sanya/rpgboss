* Make BattleAction actually work.
* Make a DamageText type of window.
* Have Battle publish events in some way to be displayed.

* Make method that auto selects an element, asserting the collection is not empty. Use it in Battle.scala.
* Window management and input managment are not directly linked. ChoiceWindows add and remove themselves to both stacks. Investigate if we can tie them together.
* Make user interface for Effects behave correctly when there are multiple StatAdd fields.
