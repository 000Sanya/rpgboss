* DamageText should appear above battle sprites.
* There should only be one battle notification going on at once.
* Make animations for BattleDamage.

* Make method that auto selects an element, asserting the collection is not empty. Use it in Battle.scala.
* Window management and input managment are not directly linked. ChoiceWindows add and remove themselves to both stacks. Investigate if we can tie them together.
* Make user interface for Effects behave correctly when there are multiple StatAdd fields.
